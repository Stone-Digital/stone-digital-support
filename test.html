					<p><strong>Welcome to LifterLMS 6.0.0!</strong></p>
<p>This new version brings you the power to build and customize certificates using the WordPress block editor! Start building beautiful certificates using all the blocks you're already familiar, the new Certificate Title block, and new certificate settings like page size (Letter or A4, for example), orientation, background color, and more. In addition to design features, this version also adds the ability to modify already-awarded certificates and achievements and to sync template updates with the click of a button.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like you may have installed LifterLMS on a staging site!</strong></p>

<p>LifterLMS watches for potential signs of a staging site and disables automatic payments so that your students do not receive duplicate charges.</p>

<p>
You can choose to enable automatic recurring payments using the buttons below. If you're not sure what to do, you can learn more <a href="https://lifterlms.com/docs/staging-sites-and-lifterlms-recurring-payments" target="_blank">here</a>. You can always change your mind later by clicking "Reset Automatic Payments" on the LifterLMS General Settings screen under Tools and Utilities.</p>
